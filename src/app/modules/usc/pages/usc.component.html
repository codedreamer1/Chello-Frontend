                </b></p>

            <p class="font-16 color-dark-grey">The regulations under 28 CFR 75 and the corresponding 18 USC 2257 statute are clear and concise. They provide explicit guidelines as to how they should be applied. <b class="color-black">The basic idea is that performers depicted in adult content must provide identification proving that they are not minors.</b> The I.D. is kept in a repository that is not public, but may be accessed by law enforcement in certain circumstances. It is essentially a method of ensuring that adult content on the Internet (or otherwise) does not inadvertently or intentionally include persons who are underage.

            <p class="font-16 color-dark-grey">
                <b class="color-black">In order to protect children from sexual exploitation crimes</b>, federal law imposes name- and age-verification, recordkeeping, and labeling requirements on producers of visual depictions of actual human beings engaged in actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct (See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257, 2257A).  This means that producers of pornography, or depictions of any sexual activity using actual people, are required to verify that the performers are of legal age (18–years–old or older) by maintaining records of the performers’ names and ages.  They also are required to disclose the location of these records.  Under the law, all records are subject to inspection.
