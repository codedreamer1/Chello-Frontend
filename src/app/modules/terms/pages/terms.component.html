                            <p class="font-16 color-dark-grey">In 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which amended U.S. copyright law to address important parts of the relationship between copyright and the internet. The three main updates were: (1) establishing protections for online service providers in certain situations if their users engage in copyright infringement, including by creating the notice-and-takedown system, which allows copyright owners to inform online service providers about infringing material so it can be taken down; (2) encouraging copyright owners to give greater access to their works in digital formats by providing them with legal protections against unauthorized access to their works (for example, hacking passwords or circumventing encryption); and (3) making it unlawful to provide false copyright management information (for example, names of authors and copyright owners, titles of works) or to remove or alter that type of information in certain circumstances.

They provide explicit guidelines as to how they should be applied. <b class="color-black">The basic idea is that performers depicted in adult content must provide identification proving that they are not minors.</b> The I.D. is kept in a repository that is not public, but may be accessed by law enforcement in certain circumstances. It is essentially a method of ensuring that adult content on the Internet (or otherwise) does not inadvertently or intentionally include persons who are underage.

This means that producers of pornography, or depictions of any sexual activity using actual people, are required to verify that the performers are of legal age (18–years–old or older) by maintaining records of the performers’ names and ages.  They also are required to disclose the location of these records.  Under the law, all records are subject to inspection.
