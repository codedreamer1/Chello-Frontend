                                Yes, there is a referral program with <b>Chello</b>. Every <b>Creator</b> will be given a referral code.

The <b>Creator</b> will be paid a {{veriable.referralCommission}}% referral revenue every month on the 3rd, for the <b>Creators</b> they refer to <b>Chello</b>. The {{veriable.referralCommission}}% is from the referred Creator business for the previous month. This is one-third of the 6% <b>Chello</b> receives.
