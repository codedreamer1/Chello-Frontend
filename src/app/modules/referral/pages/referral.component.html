                                Yes, there is a referral program with <b>Chello</b>. Every <b>Creator</b> will be
                                given a referral code. In order to qualify for the referral program, the
                                <b>Creator</b> has to pay the admin fee of $25 per month or $240 annual. The
                                <b>Creator</b> will be paid a 3% referral revenue every month on the 3rd, for the
                                <b>Creators</b> they referred to <b>Chello</b>. The 3% is from the referred
                                <b>Creator</b> business for the previous month. This is one half of the 6%
                                <b>Chello</b> receives.

                                For example, <b>Creator</b> A refers to <b>Creators</b> B and C to <b>Chello</b>. In
                                March, <b>Creator</b> B made $6000 and <b>Creator</b> C made $4000. On April 3,
